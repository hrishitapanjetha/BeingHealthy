                    <h1>How to Become Healthy</h1>
                    <h2>1. Excercise Daily</h2>
                    <img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/354460/screenshots/2147291/skip.gif" alt="">
                    <p>
                        <b>Exercise every day</b> : Exercising your body through formal fitness routines or simply
                        through being more active throughout the day is beneficial to your health. Regular exercise is
                        one of the most important steps toward a healthy body and mind, with innumerable benefits such
                        as a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s,type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You should strive for some form of physical activity each day. You don't necessarily have to
                            hit the gym seven days a week. Simply look for opportunities to be active at least 20 or 30
                            minutes each day, such as parking father away or choosing to walk somewhere instead of
                            driving, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, taking your dog for long walks, etc. You
                            will still get a lot of health benefits through daily moderate exercise</li>
                        <li>Choose an activity that's convenient and that you enjoy. If you love long walks, take your
                            dog for a brisk 30 minute walk each night. If you love biking, consider biking to work each
                            day instead of driving. Try aerobic classes, Zumba, pilates, or high-intensity training.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2> 2. Reach your ideal weight</h2>
                    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKMC9A1SS2juH3q/giphy.gif" alt="">
                    <p><b>Reach your ideal weight</b> : Carrying too much or too little body fat can affect our health
                        in many ways. Being underweight is also not ideal for your health. It's important to find a
                        comfortable and healthy balance for your frame and height. Speak with your doctor for guidance
                        as to where you fall on that spectrum.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One tool that can determine if you need to gain or lose weight by discovering your BMI. This
                            is a calculation based on your height and weight and you can use a BMI calculator online to
                            figure out if you need to gain or lose. Your BMI should be between 18.5 and 24.9. Anything
                            lower than 18.5 is considered underweight. Anything higher than 24.9 is considered
                            overweight. A BMI over 30 is considered obese.[3] Be aware that BMI is not always an
                            accurate indicator (if you are very short and very muscular, for instance, your BMI may be
                            skewed), so make sure you also talk with your doctor.</li>
                        <li>If you are overweight or underweight, talk to your doctor about a weight loss or weight gain
                            plan. You gain or lose weight by eating more or less calories than you consume each day.
                            Food labels and online nutrition calculators can help you assess the amount of calories in
                            your food. You can also use online calculators to estimate how many calories a given
                            activity burns for you considering your height and weight.</li>
                        <li>While being overweight or underweight is not healthy for your body, it is also unhealthy to
                            make very sudden or drastic changes to your diet. Remember that weight gain and loss both
                            require a slow, gradual, and consistent change to your diet and exercise routine in order to
                            be safe and healthy for you.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Exercise all of your muscle groups</h2>
                    <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/281f33464ae31aeacffe8b0acf10000e/tenor.gif?itemid=10207915"
                        alt="">
                    <p><b>Exercise all of your muscle groups : </b>Many people prefer to focus exclusively on either
                        cardio health (running, biking, etc.) or weight training. However, a truly healthy body needs to
                        exercise both sets of muscles.[4]</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not only does doing several different activities work all your muscles (which can help
                            prevent injury), it also keeps you from getting bored. Include aerobic and strength training
                            workouts in your routine.</li>
                        <li>Aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly.
                            Moderate aerobic activity would include things like walking or light cycling. Vigorous
                            activity would include things like jogging, running, and intense cycling</li>
                        <li>You should incorporate strength training twice a week. Strength training can come in the
                            form of lifting weights or engaging in activities like Pilates, which forces you to use your
                            body as a weight to strengthen and tone core muscles.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Take precautions when exercising</h2>
                    <img src="https://www.wikihow.life/images/thumb/b/bd/Become-Healthy-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid1504994-v4-728px-Become-Healthy-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp"
                        alt="">
                    <p><b>Take precautions when exercising : </b> While exercise is necessary for a healthy body, if you
                        don't follow certain precautions and exercise correctly, you put your body at risk for injuries.
                        Make sure you treat your body with respect when working out.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ease into a fitness routine. Do not try to go from a sedentary lifestyle to working out at
                            the gym five days a week. Give yourself small fitness goals, like taking a certain number of
                            steps per day, or running half a mile, then a mile, then two miles</li>
                        <li>Stay hydrated. You should sip water throughout your workouts. Becoming dehydrated can lead
                            to dizziness or headaches during your sweat session.</li>
                        <li>Have a rest day between strength training workouts.</li>
                        <li>Get a fitness partner. Having someone to walk or jog with or take group fitness classes with
                            at the local gym can be motivational. It can also help by providing you with someone you
                            know that can watch for signs that you are overdoing it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>TIPS FOR YOU - </h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you feel your body asking for a rest, listen to it. The body well equipped to repair
                            itself provided we listen and take care of it.</li>
                        <li>Increase your intake of antioxidants to fight the free radicals that have been linked to
                            cancer, heart disease, atherosclerosis, among other diseases</li>

                    <h1>How Many Calories Should You Eat per Day to Lose Weight?</h1>
                    <p>Below is a simple but highly accurate scientific calorie calculator, along with five
                        evidence-based tips on how to sustainably reduce your calorie intake.

                        Enter your details in the calculator on more section of our website to figure out how many
                        calories you should be eating per day to either maintain or lose weight.

                        The calculator is based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, a formula that numerous studies have
                        shown to be an accurate way of estimating calorie needs</p>
                    <h1>How many calories should you eat on average?</h1>
                    <p>The answer to this question depends on numerous factors, including your age, height, current
                        weight, activity level, and metabolic health, among several others.

                        When trying to lose weight, a general rule of thumb is to reduce your calorie intake to 500
                        fewer calories than your body needs to maintain your current weight. This will help you lose
                        about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body weight per week.

                        Below are average calorie ranges that consider these factors</p>

                    <h1>Women</h1>
                    <p>The average, moderately active woman between the ages of 26–50 needs to eat about 2,000 calories
                        per day to maintain her weight and 1,500 calories per day to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight
                        per week.

                        Women who are active and walk more than 3 miles per day will need to consume 2,200 calories or
                        more daily to maintain their weight and at least 1,700 calories to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of
                        weight per week.

                        Young women in their early 20s have higher calorie needs. They require about 2,200 calories per
                        day to maintain their weight.

                        Women over age 50 generally require fewer calories. The average moderately active woman over 50
                        needs about 1,800 calories per day to maintain her weight and 1,300 calories per day to lose 1
                        pound (0.45 kg) per week.

                        These estimates do not apply to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as they have
                        significantly higher calorie needs</p>
                    <h1>Men</h1>
                    <p>The average, moderately active man between the ages of 26–45 needs 2,600 calories per day to
                        maintain his weight and 2,100 calories per day to lose 1 (0.45 kg) pound per week.

                        Active men who walk more than 3 miles per day may require 2,800–3,000 calories per day to
                        maintain their weight and 2,300–2,500 calories per day to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight per
                        week.

                        Young men ages 19–25 have higher energy needs. They require an average of 2,800 calories per day
                        to maintain their weight and up to 3,000 if they’re active. To lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week,
                        moderately active young men should consume 2,300–2,500 calories daily.

                        Energy needs decrease as men age. Between the ages of 46–65, moderately active men need an
                        average of 2,400 calories per day. After 66 years, the average man’s calorie needs decrease to
                        about 2,200 calories per day.</p>

                    <h1>Children</h1>
                    <p>Children have widely varying calorie needs based on their age, size, and activity level.

                        Whereas the average toddler requires 1,200–1,400 calories per day, the average moderately active
                        teenager requires 2,000–2,800 calories per day. Active teenage boys require even more.

                        Children who are growing and developing normally and engage in regular physical activity usually
                        don’t need to count calories. When they’re provided with a range of healthy options to eat, most
                        moderately active kids naturally eat the amount of food their body requires.</p>

                        In fact, many studies show that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your
                        health (1Trusted Source).

                        Ketogenic diets may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s
                        disease (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).

                        Here is a detailed beginner’s guide to the keto diet.</p>

                    <h1>Keto basics</h1>
                    <p>The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the
                        Atkins and low carb diets.

                        It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction
                        in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.

                        When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also
                        turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain (6Trusted Source).

                        Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along
                        with the increased ketones, has some health benefits</p>

                        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                        <p>The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet. It lowers blood sugar and insulin levels and
                            shifts the body’s metabolism away from carbs and toward fat and ketones.</p>

                    <h1>Different types of ketogenic diets</h1>
                    <ul>
                        There are several versions of the ketogenic diet, including:
                        <li><b>Standard ketogenic diet (SKD)</b>: This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat
                            diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs </li>
                        <li><b>Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD):</b>This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such
                            as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.</li>
                        <li><b>Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD):</b>Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD):</li>
                        <li><b>High protein ketogenic diet: </b> This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but
                            includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, only the standard and high protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively.
                        Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by
                        bodybuilders or athletes.

                        The information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although
                        many of the same principles also apply to the other versions.

                    <h1>Yoga – Benefits Beyond the Mat</h1>
                    <p>Yoga, an ancient practice and meditation, has become increasingly popular in today's busy
                        society. For many people, yoga provides a retreat from their chaotic and busy lives. This is
                        true whether you're practicing downward facing dog posture on a mat in your bedroom, in an
                        ashram in India or even in New York City's Times Square. Yoga provides many other mental and
                        physical benefits. Some of these extend to the kitchen table.</p>
                    <h2>Types of Yoga</h2>
                    <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/49b9990b0c11428deb8cadf9eed0924f/tenor.gif" alt="">
                    <p>There are many types of yoga. Hatha (a combination of many styles) is one of the most popular
                        styles. It is a more physical type of yoga rather than a still, meditative form. Hatha yoga
                        focuses on pranayamas (breath-controlled exercises). These are followed by a series of asanas
                        (yoga postures), which end with savasana (a resting period).

                        The goal during yoga practice is to challenge yourself physically, but not to feel overwhelmed.
                        At this "edge," the focus is on your breath while your mind is accepting and calm.</p>

                    <h2>A Better Body Image</h2>
                    <p>Yoga develops inner awareness. It focuses your attention on your body's abilities at the present
                        moment. It helps develop breath and strength of mind and body. It's not about physical
                        appearance.

                        Yoga studios typically don't have mirrors. This is so people can focus their awareness inward
                        rather than how a pose — or the people around them — looks. Surveys have found that those who
                        practiced yoga were more aware of their bodies than people who didn't practice yoga. They were
                        also more satisfied with and less critical of their bodies. For these reasons, yoga has become
                        an integral part in the treatment of eating disorders and programs that promote positive body
                        image and self-esteem.</p>
                    <h2>Becoming a Mindful Eater</h2>
                    <p>Mindfulness refers to focusing your attention on what you are experiencing in the present moment
                        without judging yourself.

                        Practicing yoga has been shown to increase mindfulness not just in class, but in other areas of
                        a person's life.

                        Researchers describe mindful eating as a nonjudgmental awareness of the physical and emotional
                        sensations associated with eating. They developed a questionnaire to measure mindful eating
                        using these behaviors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eating even when full (disinhibition)</li>
                        <li>Being aware of how food looks, tastes and smells</li>
                        <li>Eating in response to environmental cues, such as the sight or smell of food
                        </li>
                        <li>Eating when sad or stressed (emotional eating)
                        </li>
                        <li>Eating when distracted by other things
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The researchers found that people who practiced yoga were more mindful eaters according to their
                        scores. Both years of yoga practice and number of minutes of practice per week were associated
                        with better mindful eating scores. Practicing yoga helps you be more aware how your body feels.
                        This heightened awareness can carry over to mealtime as you savor each bite or sip, and note how
                        food smells, tastes and feels in you mouth.</p>

                    <h2>A Boost to Weight Loss and Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>People who practice yoga and are mindful eaters are more in tune with their bodies. They may be
                        more sensitive to hunger cues and feelings of fullness.

                        Researchers found that people who practiced yoga for at least 30 minutes once a week for at
                        least four years, gained less weight during middle adulthood. People who were overweight
                        actually lost weight. Overall, those who practiced yoga had lower body mass indexes (BMIs)
                        compared with those who did not practice yoga. Researchers attributed this to mindfulness.
                        Mindful eating can lead to a more positive relationship with food and eating.</p>
                    <h2>Enhancing Fitness</h2>
                    <p>Yoga is known for its ability to soothe tension and anxiety in the mind and body. But it can also
                        have an impact on a person's exercise capacity.

                        Researchers studied a small group of sedentary individuals who had not practiced yoga before.
                        After eight weeks of practicing yoga at least twice a week for a total of 180 minutes,
                        participants had greater muscle strength and endurance, flexibility and cardio-respiratory
                        fitness.</p>
                    <h2>Cardiovascular Benefits</h2>
                    <p>Several small studies have found yoga to have a positive effect on cardiovascular risk factors:
                        It helped lower blood pressure in people who have hypertension. It's likely that the yoga
                        restores "baroreceptor sensitivity." This helps the body senses imbalances in blood pressure and
                        maintain balance.

                        Another study found that practicing yoga improved lipid profiles in healthy patients as well as
                        patients with known coronary artery disease. It also lowered excessive blood sugar levels in
                        people with non-insulin dependent diabetes and reduced their need for medications. Yoga is now
                        being included in many cardiac rehabilitation programs due to its cardiovascular and
                        stress-relieving benefits.

                        Before you start a new exercise program, be sure to check with your doctor.

                        Researchers are also studying if yoga can help people with depression and arthritis, and improve
                        survival from cancer.</p>

                    <h1>What Is Ayurveda?</h1>
                    <p>Ayurvedic medicine (“Ayurveda” for short) is one of the world's oldest holistic (“whole-body”)
                        healing systems. It was developed more than 3,000 years ago in India.

                        It’s based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind,
                        body, and spirit. Its main goal is to promote good health, not fight disease. But treatments may
                        be geared toward specific health problems.

                        In the United States, it’s considered a form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
                    </p>
                    <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6UBOVwecYOA/UsksGS2RLZI/AAAAAAAAAEk/ljrgW8gy9EU/s320/bioenergetica.gif"
                        alt="">
                    <h2>Ayurveda and Your Life Energy</h2>
                    <p>Students of CAM therapy believe that everything in the universe – dead or alive – is connected.
                        If your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe, you have good health. When
                        something disrupts this balance, you get sick. Among the things that can upset this balance are
                        genetic or birth defects, injuries, climate and seasonal change, age, and your emotions.

                        Those who practice Ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the
                        universe: space, air, fire, water, and earth.</p>
                    <p>These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. They
                        control how your body works. They are Vata dosha (space and air); Pitta dosha (fire and water);
                        and Kapha dosha (water and earth).

                        Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others.
                        Each one controls a different body function. It’s believed that your chances of getting sick --
                        and the health issues you develop -- are linked to the balance of your doshas.

                    </p>
                    <h2>Vata Dosha</h2>
                    <p>Those who practice Ayurveda believe this is the most powerful of all three doshas. It controls
                        very basic body functions, like how cells divide. It also controls your mind, breathing, blood
                        flow, heart function, and ability to get rid of waste through your intestines. Things that can
                        disrupt it include eating again too soon after a meal, fear, grief, and staying up too late.

                        If vata dosha is your main life force, you’re thought to be more likely to develop conditions
                        like anxiety, asthma, heart disease, skin problems, and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
                    <h2>Pitta Dosha</h2>
                    <p>This energy controls your digestion, metabolism (how well you break down foods), and certain
                        hormones that are linked to your appetite.

                        Things that can disrupt it are eating sour or spicy foods and spending too much time in the sun.

                        If it’s your main life force, you’re thought to be more likely to develop conditions like
                        Crohn’s disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, and infections</p>
                    <h1>Ayurvedic Treatment</h1>
                    <p>An Ayurvedic practitioner will create a treatment plan specifically designed for you. They’ll
                        take into account your unique physical and emotional makeup, your primary life force, and the
                        balance between all three of these elements.

                        The goal of treatment is to cleanse your body of undigested food, which can stay in your body
                        and lead to illness. The cleansing process—called “panchakarma”— is designed to reduce your
                        symptoms and restore harmony and balance.

                        To achieve this, an Ayurvedic practitioner might rely on blood purification, massage, medical
                        oils, herbs, and enemas or laxatives.</p>
                    <h2>Does It Work?</h2>
                    <p>There are a few state-approved Ayurvedic schools in the U.S. But there’s no national standard
                        training or certification program for those who practice this alternative therapy.

                        The FDA doesn’t review or approve Ayurvedic products. In fact, it’s banned certain ones from
                        entering the country since 2007. What’s more, the agency has warned that 1 in 5 Ayurvedic
                        medicines contain toxic metals, like lead, mercury, and arsenic. These heavy metals can cause
                        life-threatening illness, especially in children.

                        Always talk to your doctor before you try Ayurveda or any other alternative medical treatment.

                    <h1>What is ascorbic acid?</h1>
                    <p>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) occurs naturally in foods such as citrus fruit, tomatoes, potatoes, and
                        leafy vegetables. Vitamin C is important for bones and connective tissues, muscles, and blood
                        vessels. Vitamin C also helps the body absorb iron, which is needed for red blood cell
                        production.

                        Ascorbic acid is used to treat and prevent vitamin C deficiency.

                        Ascorbic acid may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide</p>

                    <h1>Warnings</h1>
                    <p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers
                        about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p>

                    <h2>Before taking this medicine</h2>
                    <ul>
                        You should not use ascorbic acid if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vitamin C
                        supplement.

                        Ask a doctor or pharmacist about using ascorbic acid if you have:

                        <li>kidney disease or a history of kidney stones;</li>
                        <li>hereditary iron overload disorder (hematochromatosis); or</li>
                        <li>if you smoke (smoking can make ascorbic acid less effective).</li>

                        <p>Your dose needs may be different during pregnancy or while you are breast-feeding a baby. Do
                            not use ascorbic acid without your doctor's advice in either case.</p>

                    <h1>Artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes</h1>
                    <p>If you're trying to reduce the sugar and calories in your diet, you may be turning to artificial
                        sweeteners or other sugar substitutes. You aren't alone.

                        Artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a variety of food and beverages
                        marketed as "sugar-free" or "diet," including soft drinks and baked goods. Just what are all
                        these sweeteners? And what's their role in your diet?</p>


                    <h2>Understanding artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes</h2>

                    <p>Sugar substitutes are sweeteners that you use instead of regular table sugar (sucrose).
                        Artificial sweeteners are just one type of sugar substitute.

                        The topic of sugar substitutes can be confusing. One problem is that the terminology is often
                        open to interpretation.

                        Some manufacturers call their sweeteners "natural" even though they're processed or refined.
                        Stevia preparations are one example. And some artificial sweeteners are derived from naturally
                        occurring substances — sucralose comes from sugar.</p>

                    <h2>Natural sweeteners</h2>
                    <p>Natural sweeteners are sugar substitutes that are often promoted as healthier options than sugar
                        or other sugar substitutes. But even these "natural sweeteners" often undergo processing and
                        refining.

                        Natural sweeteners that the FDA recognizes as generally safe include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fruit juices and nectars
                        </li>
                        <li>Honey</li>
                        <li>Molasses</li>
                        <li>Maple syrup
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Moderation is key
                    </h1>
                    <p>When choosing sugar substitutes, it pays to be a savvy consumer. Artificial sweeteners and sugar
                        substitutes can help with weight management. But they aren't a magic bullet and should be used
                        only in moderation.

                        Food marketed as sugar-free isn't calorie-free, so it can still cause weight gain. Keep in mind
                        that processed foods, which often contain sugar substitutes, generally don't offer the same
                        health benefits as whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables.</p>

                    <h1>Dietary fiber: Essential for a healthy diet
                    </h1>
                    <p>Eat more fiber. You've probably heard it before. But do you know why fiber is so good for your
                        health?

                        Dietary fiber — found mainly in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes — is probably best
                        known for its ability to prevent or relieve constipation. But foods containing fiber can provide
                        other health benefits as well, such as helping to maintain a healthy weight and lowering your
                        risk of diabetes, heart disease and some types of cancer.

                        Selecting tasty foods that provide fiber isn't difficult. Find out how much dietary fiber you
                        need, the foods that contain it, and how to add them to meals and snacks.</p>

                    <h2>What is dietary fiber?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, includes the parts of plant foods your body can't
                        digest or absorb. Unlike other food components, such as fats, proteins or carbohydrates — which
                        your body breaks down and absorbs — fiber isn't digested by your body. Instead, it passes
                        relatively intact through your stomach, small intestine and colon and out of your body.

                        Fiber is commonly classified as soluble, which dissolves in water, or insoluble, which doesn't
                        dissolve.
                        <li><b>Soluble fiber.</b> This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material. It
                            can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. Soluble fiber is found in oats, peas,
                            beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium.</li>
                        <li><b>Insoluble fiber.</b> This type of fiber promotes the movement of material through your
                            digestive system and increases stool bulk, so it can be of benefit to those who struggle
                            with constipation or irregular stools. Whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, beans and
                            vegetables, such as cauliflower, green beans and potatoes, are good sources of insoluble
                            fiber.</li>


                    </ul>

                    <h2>Benefits of a high-fiber diet</h2>
                    <ul>
                        A high-fiber diet:

                        <li><b>Normalizes bowel movements. </b>Dietary fiber increases the weight and size of your stool
                            and softens it. A bulky stool is easier to pass, decreasing your chance of constipation. If
                            you have loose, watery stools, fiber may help to solidify the stool because it absorbs water
                            and adds bulk to stool.</li>

                        <li><b>Helps maintain bowel health.</b> A high-fiber diet may lower your risk of developing
                            hemorrhoids and small pouches in your colon (diverticular disease). Studies have also found
                            that a high-fiber diet likely lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. Some fiber is fermented
                            in the colon. Researchers are looking at how this may play a role in preventing diseases of
                            the colon.</li>
                        <li><b>Lowers cholesterol levels.</b> Soluble fiber found in beans, oats, flaxseed and oat bran
                            may help lower total blood cholesterol levels by lowering low-density lipoprotein, or "bad,"
                            cholesterol levels. Studies also have shown that high-fiber foods may have other
                            heart-health benefits, such as reducing blood pressure and inflammation.</li>
                        <li><b>Helps control blood sugar levels</b>In people with diabetes, fiber — particularly soluble
                            fiber — can slow the absorption of sugar and help improve blood sugar levels. A healthy diet
                            that includes insoluble fiber may also reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</li>
                        <li><b>Aids in achieving healthy weight.</b>High-fiber foods tend to be more filling than
                            low-fiber foods, so you're likely to eat less and stay satisfied longer. And high-fiber
                            foods tend to take longer to eat and to be less "energy dense," which means they have fewer
                            calories for the same volume of food.</li>
                        <li><b>Helps you live longer.</b> Studies suggest that increasing your dietary fiber intake —
                            especially cereal fiber — is associated with a reduced risk of dying from cardiovascular
                            disease and all cancers.</li>


                    </ul>

                    <h2>Fiber supplements and fortified foods</h2>
                    <p>Whole foods rather than fiber supplements are generally better. Fiber supplements — such as
                        Metamucil, Citrucel and FiberCon — don't provide the variety of fibers, vitamins, minerals and
                        other beneficial nutrients that foods do.

                        Another way to get more fiber is to eat foods, such as cereal, granola bars, yogurt and ice
                        cream, with fiber added. The added fiber usually is labeled as "inulin" or "chicory root." Some
                        people complain of gassiness after eating foods with added fiber.

                        However, some people may still need a fiber supplement if dietary changes aren't sufficient or
                        if they have certain medical conditions, such as constipation, diarrhea or irritable bowel
                        syndrome. Check with your doctor before taking fiber supplements.</p>

                    <p>he human body comprises around 60% water.

                        It’s commonly recommended that you drink eight 8-ounce (237-mL) glasses of water per day (the 8×8 rule).
                        
                        Although there’s little science behind this specific rule, staying hydrated is important.
                        
                        Here are 7 evidence-based health benefits of drinking plenty of water.</p>
                        <h3>1. Helps maximize physical performance</h3>
                        <p>If you don’t stay hydrated, your physical performance can suffer.

                            This is particularly important during intense exercise or high heat.
                            
                            Dehydration can have a noticeable effect if you lose as little as 2% of your body’s water content. However, it isn’t uncommon for athletes to lose as much as 6–10% of their water weight via sweat (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).
                            
                            This can lead to altered body temperature control, reduced motivation, and increased fatigue. It can also make exercise feel much more difficult, both physically and mentally (3).
                            
                            Optimal hydration has been shown to prevent this from happening, and it may even reduce the oxidative stress that occurs during high intensity exercise. This isn’t surprising when you consider that muscle is about 80% water (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).
                            
                            If you exercise intensely and tend to sweat, staying hydrated can help you perform at your absolute best.</p>

                                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                                <p>Losing as little as 2% of your body’s water content can significantly impair your physical performance.</p>
                            </section>

                            <h3>2. Significantly affects energy levels and brain function</h3>
                            <p>Your brain is strongly influenced by your hydration status.

                                Studies show that even mild dehydration, such as the loss of 1–3% of body weight, can impair many aspects of brain function.
                                
                                In a study in young women, researchers found that fluid loss of 1.4% after exercise impaired both mood and concentration. It also increased the frequency of headaches (6Trusted Source).
                                
                                Many members of this same research team conducted a similar study in young men. They found that fluid loss of 1.6% was detrimental to working memory and increased feelings of anxiety and fatigue (7).
                                
                                A fluid loss of 1–3% equals about 1.5–4.5 pounds (0.5–2 kg) of body weight loss for a person weighing 150 pounds (68 kg). This can easily occur through normal daily activities, let alone during exercise or high heat.
                                
                                Many other studies, with subjects ranging from children to older adults, have shown that mild dehydration can impair mood, memory, and brain performance </p>

                                <h3>3. May help prevent and treat headaches</h3>
                                <p>Dehydration can trigger headaches and migraine in some individuals (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).

                                    Research has shown that a headache is one of the most common symptoms of dehydration. For example, a study in 393 people found that 40% of the participants experienced a headache as a result of dehydration (14Trusted Source).
                                    
                                    What’s more, some studies have shown that drinking water can help relieve headaches in those who experience frequent headaches.
                                    
                                    A study in 102 men found that drinking an additional 50.7 ounces (1.5 liters) of water per day resulted in significant improvements on the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life scale, a scoring system for migraine symptoms (16).
                                    
                                    Plus, 47% of the men who drank more water reported headache improvement, while only 25% of the men in the control group reported this effect (16).
                                    
                                    However, not all studies agree, and researchers have concluded that because of the lack of high quality studies, more research is needed to confirm how increasing hydration may help improve headache symptoms and decrease headache frequency</p>

                                    <h3>4. May help relieve constipation</h3>
                                    <p>Constipation is a common problem that’s characterized by infrequent bowel movements and difficulty passing stool.

                                        Increasing fluid intake is often recommended as a part of the treatment protocol, and there’s some evidence to back this up.
                                        
                                        Low water consumption appears to be a risk factor for constipation in both younger and older individuals (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).
                                        
                                        Increasing hydration may help decrease constipation.
                                        
                                        Mineral water may be a particularly beneficial beverage for those with constipation.
                                        
                                        Studies have shown that mineral water that’s rich in magnesium and sodium improves bowel movement frequency and consistency in people with constipation</p>

                                            <p>Drinking plenty of water may help prevent and relieve constipation, especially in people who generally don’t drink enough water.</p>
